"In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a [1] is a graph which is permitted to have multiple edges, that is, edges that have the same end nodes.",1 - multigraph,,Multigraph,also called parallel edges,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph
"In mathematics, a [1] is a generalization of a graph in which an edge can join any number of vertices.",1 - hypergraph,,Hypergraph,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph
"The adjacency matrix of a graph should be distinguished from its incidence matrix, a different matrix representation whose elements indicate whether vertex-edge pairs are incident or not, and its degree matrix, which contains information about the degree of each vertex.
 What does incident mean?",a vertex is incident with an edge if the vertex is one of the two vertices the edge connects,,Adjacency matrix,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix
"In mathematics and computer science, [1] is one of the basic concepts of graph theory: it asks for the minimum number of elements (nodes or edges) that need to be removed to separate the remaining nodes into two or more isolated subgraphs.",1 - connectivity,,Connectivity (graph theory),It is closely related to the theory of network flow problems. The connectivity of a graph is an important measure of its resilience as a network.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)
A directed graph is called [1] connected if replacing all of its directed edges with undirected edges produces a connected (undirected) graph.,1 - weakly,,Connectivity (graph theory),"It is unilaterally connected or unilateral (also called semiconnected) if it contains a directed path from u to v or a directed path from v to u for every pair of vertices u, v. It is strongly connected, or simply strong, if it contains a directed path from u to v and a directed path from v to u for every pair of vertices u, v.
