2 - Weak",,Mark Granovetter,"Its thesis is that weak ties-acquaintanceships that are not reinforced by many mutual friendships-are especially pivotal in the flow of information. It has become a core idea in the field of social networks. In marketing, information science, or politics, weak ties enable reaching populations and audiences that are not accessible via strong ties.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Granovetter
"In graph theory, a [1], [2], cut-edge, or cut arc is an edge of a graph whose deletion increases the graph's number of connected components. Equivalently, an edge is a [1] if and only if it is not contained in any [3].","1 - bridge

"For a connected graph, a bridge can uniquely determine a [1], a partition of the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets.",1 - cut,,Bridge (graph theory),"Any cut determines a cut-set, the set of edges that have one endpoint in each subset of the partition. These edges are said to cross the cut. In a connected graph, each cut-set determines a unique cut, and in some cases cuts are identified with their cut-sets rather than with their vertex partitions.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(graph_theory)
[1] bridges are ties between two nodes in a social graph that are the shortest route by which information might travel from those connected to one to those connected to the other. They differ from regular bridges in that the end points of the local bridge once the bridge has been deleted cannot have a tie directly between them and should not share any common neighbors.,1 - Local,,Bridge (interpersonal),Also if the local bridge is deleted the distance between these two nodes will be increased to a value strictly more than two.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(interpersonal)
"Strong Triadic Closure Property is that if a node has strong ties to two neighbors, then these neighbors must have at least a [1] tie between them.",1 - weak,,Triadic closure,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triadic_closure
