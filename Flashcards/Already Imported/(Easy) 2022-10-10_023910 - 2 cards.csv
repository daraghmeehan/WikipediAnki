"[1] had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain, but Broca's research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship, and has been described as ""epoch-making"" and ""pivotal"" to the fields of neurolinguistics and cognitive science.",1 - Phrenologists,,Neurolinguistics,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurolinguistics
"Later, Carl [1], after whom [1]'s area is named, proposed that different areas of the brain were specialized for different linguistic tasks, with [2]'s area handling the motor production of speech, and [1]'s area handling auditory speech comprehension.","1 - Wernicke
