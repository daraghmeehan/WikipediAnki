"[1] indices are answers to the question ""What characterizes an important vertex? The answer is given in terms of a real-valued function on the vertices of a graph, where the values produced are expected to provide a ranking which identifies the most important nodes.",1 - Centrality,,Centrality,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality
"In a connected graph, [1] centrality of a node is a measure of centrality in a network, calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node and all other nodes in the graph.",1 - closeness,,Closeness centrality,"Also called just 'closeness' -  the more central a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes
It was defined by Alex Bavelas in 1950",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closeness_centrality
[1] centrality quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes.,1 - Betweenness,,Centrality,It was introduced as a measure for quantifying the control of a human on the communication between other humans in a social network by Linton Freeman.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality
"The historically first and conceptually simplest measure of centrality in graph theory is [1] centrality, which is defined as the number of links incident upon a node (i.e., the number of ties that a node has).",1 - degree,,Centrality,"The degree can be interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of a node for catching whatever is flowing through the network (such as a virus, or some information).
In the case of a directed network (where ties have direction), we usually define two separate measures of degree centrality, namely indegree and outdegree. Accordingly, indegree is a count of the number of ties directed to the node and outdegree is the number of ties that the node directs to others.
When ties are associated to some positive aspects such as friendship or collaboration, indegree is often interpreted as a form of popularity, and outdegree as gregariousness.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality
