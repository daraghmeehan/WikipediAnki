4 - Jon Kleinberg",3 - which field of techniques,HITS algorithm,"The idea behind Hubs and Authorities stemmed from a particular insight into the creation of web pages when the Internet was originally forming; that is, certain web pages, known as hubs, served as large directories that were not actually authoritative in the information that they held, but were used as compilations of a broad catalog of information that led users direct to other authoritative pages. In other words, a good hub represents a page that pointed to many other pages, while a good authority represents a page that is linked by many different hubs.

The scheme therefore assigns two scores for each page: its authority, which estimates the value of the content of the page, and its hub value, which estimates the value of its links to other pages. ",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITS_algorithm
