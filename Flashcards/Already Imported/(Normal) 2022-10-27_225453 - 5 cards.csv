"The premise of symbolic NLP is well-summarized by [1] [1]'s [2] [2] experiment: given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts.","1 - John Searle

"The 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in NLP. Focus areas of the time included research on rule-based parsing (e.g., the development of [1] as a computational operationalization of generative grammar), morphology (e.g., two-level morphology), semantics (e.g., [2] algorithm), reference (e.g., within Centering Theory) and other areas of natural language understanding (e.g., in the [3] Structure Theory).","1 - HPSG
