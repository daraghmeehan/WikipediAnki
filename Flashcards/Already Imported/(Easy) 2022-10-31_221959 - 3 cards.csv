"[1] is a measure of the structure of networks or graphs which measures the strength of division of a network into [2] (also called groups, clusters or communities). Networks with high [1] have dense connections between the nodes within [2] but sparse connections between nodes in different [2]. [1] is often used in optimization methods for detecting community structure in networks. However, it has been shown that [1] suffers a [3] [3] and, therefore, it is unable to detect small communities.","1 - Modularity
